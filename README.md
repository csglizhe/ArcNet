How to Submit Experimental Data
Experimental and Modeling Results will be submitted, stored, and made publicly available on the ArcNet GitHub Repository. Experimental data may be shared by submitting pull requests to this repository.
File Format
Experimental and Model results should be organized in simple ASCII comma-delimited files (*.csv files) with clear header names. Note: For all submitted measurement data, please ensure that results are obtained with a data acquisition rate between 1kHz and 1MHz.
File Naming
For simplicity, please save measurement results with a name indicating Standard Code and the Test items, for example: UL1699-2019_ 41.1 General..csv
File Organization
Measurement data from repeated experiments should be saved and submitted as separate files, numbered sequentially (e.g., UL1699-2019_ 41.1 General1.csv and UL1699-2019_ 41.1 General2.csv).
File Description
Please also include a separate README file (.txt or .docx) that provides a description of the test conditions of all experiments conducted and submitted.
Note, some iteration on formatting may be required before the results can be merged into the ArcNet database.
